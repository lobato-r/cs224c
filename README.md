Final project for CS 224C: NLP for CSS.

In this project, I try to describe and compare the different communities in Reddit that are dedicated to give advice on relationships and dating. By using public data from Reddit, I show some of the differences and similarities between these subreddits. I use sentiment analysis to show that original posters and commentators write in the same sentimental language. Then I show through topic modeling how there are 3 main topics in these communities: normal dating behaviors, non-amorous relationships, and toxic views of relationships.  At last I implement word-embeddings to show how some communities are in the same tune while talking about relationships and others treat relationships as something completely different.
